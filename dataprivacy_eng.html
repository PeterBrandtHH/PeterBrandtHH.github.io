<h2>Applicable legal bases</h2>
<p>In the following we inform you about the legal basis of the Data Protection Ordinance (DSGVO), on the basis of which we process personal data. Please note that, in addition to the provisions of the DSGVO, the national data protection regulations in your or our country of residence and domicile may also apply.<br><br>Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f.

In particular, this includes the Act on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special provisions on the right of information, the right of deletion, the right of objection, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission as well as automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. Furthermore, it regulates data processing for the purposes of the employment relationship (ยง 26 BDSG), in particular with regard to the establishment, execution or termination of employment relationships as well as the consent of employees. Furthermore, state data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.</p>
<h2>Transmission and disclosure of personal data</h2>
<p>As part of our processing of personal data, it may happen that the data is transferred to other offices, companies, legally independent organisational units or persons or that it is disclosed to them. Recipients of this data may include, for example, payment institutions within the framework of payment transactions, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases, we observe the legal requirements and in particular conclude corresponding contracts or agreements with the recipients of your data which serve to protect your data.</p>

<p>If we process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) or the processing takes place in the context of the use of services of third parties or the disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, bodies or companies, this is only done in accordance with the legal requirements.<br><br>Subject to express consent or transfer required by contract or law, we will only process or have the data processed in third countries with a recognised level of data protection, which includes US processors certified under the "Privacy Shield", or on the basis of special guarantees, such as a contractual obligation through so-called standard protection clauses of the EU Commission, the existence of certifications or binding internal data protection regulations (Art. 44 to 49 DSGVO, information page of the EU Commission: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_de">https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_de</a>)</p>

<p>The data processed by us will be deleted in accordance with the statutory provisions as soon as their consent permitted for processing is revoked or other permissions lapse (e.g. if the purpose of processing this data has lapsed or it is not necessary for the purpose).<br><br>If the data are not deleted because they are required for other and legally permissible purposes, their processing will be limited to these purposes. This means that the data will be blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be stored for commercial or tax reasons or whose storage is necessary to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.<br><br>Further information on the deletion of personal data can also be found in the individual data protection notices of this data protection declaration.</p>
